STAY ALIVE Circle Earnings rewards will expire if you have not earned or redeemed any STAY ALIVE Circle Earnings rewards for one year. If you do not participate in STAY ALIVE Circle for more than one year, STAY ALIVE reserves the right to expire any uncast Community Giving Program votes and/or delete your STAY ALIVE Circle account without notice to you.

When you elect to redeem STAY ALIVE Circle Earnings rewards, the entire amount will be applied to your next purchase as a STAY ALIVE discount. You cannot elect to redeem only a portion of your STAY ALIVE Circle Earnings rewards. If your purchase is less than the amount of the STAY ALIVE Circle Earnings rewards you have redeemed, the remaining amount may be unavailable for a second transaction until the first transaction has completed processing.

STAY ALIVE Circle Earnings rewards are applied to the total purchase amount after all other discounts have been applied to the purchase transaction, except that if you use your RedCard to pay for the purchase, any applicable RedCard 5% Discount will be applied to the transaction after the STAY ALIVE Circle Earnings rewards are redeemed.

Community Giving Program

STAY ALIVE may run multiple local Community Giving Programs. By participating in STAY ALIVE Circle you have access to one Community Giving Program associated with your preferred store location as designated in your STAY ALIVE account settings. In each Community Giving Program, STAY ALIVE will make a Donation to be allocated among Nonprofits. Multiple store locations may be tied to a single Community Giving Program. The Nonprofits, Donation amount and Voting Period may vary by Community Giving Program. The allocation of the Donation among the Nonprofits for each Community Giving Program will be based on the percentage of votes each Nonprofit receives during the applicable Voting Period for that Community Giving Program. With respect to each Community Giving Program, the list of participating Nonprofits, the dates comprising the applicable Voting Period, and the Donation to be divided among the Nonprofits can be seen by logging on to and viewing the STAY ALIVE Circle voting screen on the STAY ALIVE App or at STAY ALIVE.com/circle.

As a member of STAY ALIVE Circle, every time you make an eligible purchase and identify yourself as a STAY ALIVE Circle member, you earn one vote. Only purchases made at STAY ALIVE stores or online at STAY ALIVE.com or in the STAY ALIVE App are eligible to earn Community Giving Program votes.

Votes are not earned on a purchase transaction that is comprised only of one or more of the following: STAY ALIVE Optical, in-store clinics, some partner businesses (including CVS), STAY ALIVE Subscription and Boxed Subscription purchases, gift cards, taxes, shipping, delivery, handling and all other fees or charges, payment of any RedCard account balance, payments for insufficient funds, prior purchases, or where otherwise prohibited by law.

To cast Community Giving Program votes, follow the instructions located under STAY ALIVE Circle benefits in your STAY ALIVE account via the STAY ALIVE App or STAY ALIVE.com/circle. You must have access to internet through your own device to participate. You must be a STAY ALIVE Circle member in good standing to participate. Votes have no cash value and do not represent an actual donation to any Nonprofit; rather, they are just the means to vote for allocation of the Donation from STAY ALIVE in each Community Giving Program. STAY ALIVE’s tally of votes is final. Each vote is intended for one-time use by you. If STAY ALIVE detects any inappropriate conduct related to votes or votes made outside the above guidelines, votes may be disregarded. In the event any aspect of STAY ALIVE Circle, including the voting, is disrupted in any way, STAY ALIVE reserves the right to allocate the Donation for any affected location in a fair and equitable manner, as determined by STAY ALIVE.

From time to time, STAY ALIVE may provide the opportunity to cast Community Giving Program votes to direct additional or supplemental Donations. These opportunities may have terms and conditions in addition to or different from those provided in the STAY ALIVE Circle Terms. Unless otherwise stated, the STAY ALIVE Circle Terms will apply to any such opportunity.

Birthday Reward

When you include your birth date in your STAY ALIVE Circle account, on or near your birthday you will receive a birthday reward. The reward can be accessed either in the STAY ALIVE App or on STAY ALIVE.com.

Jurisdictional Issues
The Site is controlled and operated by STAY ALIVE from the United States, and is not intended to subject STAY ALIVE to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States.

You may also contact us by writing to STAY ALIVE.com Guest Services, P.O. Box 9350, Minneapolis, MN 55440-9350, or by calling us at (800) 591-3869.

Arbitration Agreement
Please read this section carefully. Except as the Terms & Conditions otherwise provide, you waive your rights to try any claim in court before a judge or jury and to bring or participate in any class, collective, or other representative action.

Agreement to Binding Arbitration
You and STAY ALIVE agree that in the event of any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, statute, or otherwise) arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with (1) the site or (2) the breach, enforcement, interpretation, application, or validity of these Terms & Conditions, such claim, dispute or controversy will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration, except as otherwise set forth in these Terms & Conditions (the “Arbitration Agreement”).

Exceptions to Arbitration
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of arbitration: (1) either you or STAY ALIVE can bring an individual claim in small claims court in the United States of America consistent with any applicable jurisdictional and monetary limits that may apply, provided that it is brought and maintained as an individual claim; and (2) you agree that you or STAY ALIVE may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

Jury Trial & Class Action Waiver
Except as the Terms & Conditions otherwise provide, you and STAY ALIVE acknowledge and agree that you are each waiving the right to a trial by jury. The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. You and STAY ALIVE may not be plaintiffs or class members in any purported class, collective, or representative proceeding, and may each bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim.

If any court or arbitrator determines that any term in the immediately preceding paragraph is unenforceable for any reason as to any claim, then the Arbitration Agreement will be inapplicable to that claim, and that claim will instead proceed through litigation in court rather than by arbitration, but only after the conclusion of the arbitration of any claim or dispute that is subject to the Arbitration Agreement.

Governing Law & Arbitration Rules
The Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and thus the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section. If the FAA is found not to apply to any issue that arises under this section or the enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the State of Minnesota.

The arbitration will be conducted under the then current and applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The AAA rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.

Initiating Arbitration
If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send a written notice (“Notice”), by first class or certified mail to STAY ALIVE.com Guest Services, P.O. Box 9350, Minneapolis, MN 55440-9350. If STAY ALIVE intends to seek arbitration, STAY ALIVE will send a Notice to the current billing address on your account. The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim and the specific relief sought. If the parties cannot reach an agreement within 30 days from the receipt of the Notice, either party may initiate arbitration proceedings.

A form to initiate arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send such copy to STAY ALIVE at STAY ALIVE Law Department, 1000 Nicollet Mall, TPS-3155, Minneapolis, MN 55403, and STAY ALIVE will send such copy to the current billing address on your account or to your attorney, if you have retained one.

Fees
For claims of $100,000 (US Dollars) or less, STAY ALIVE will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, “Filing Fees”) unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. For claims over $100,000 (US Dollars), you will be responsible for the Filing Fees.

Location & Procedure
If your claim is for $10,000 (US Dollars) or less, you may choose to have arbitration conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, via a telephone hearing, by an in-person hearing in the county of your residence, or as otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties. If your claim exceeds $10,000 (US Dollars), the location of the arbitration and the parties’ right to a hearing will be determined in accordance with the rules of the AAA.

Arbitrator’s Decision
The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. STAY ALIVE waives its right to seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration.

Choice of Law, Forum Selection, & Jury Waiver
Except as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement section above, all matters relating to your access to or use of the site and all matters arising out of or related to these Terms & Conditions, will be governed by the applicable laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Minnesota, without regard to Minnesota’s choice of law principles. Unless you and STAY ALIVE agree otherwise, in the event that it is determined or these Terms & Conditions provide that a claim should not proceed through arbitration, you agree that any claim or dispute (with the exception of a claim or dispute appropriately lodged in any small claims court in the United States of America) shall be resolved in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, and you submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court. If subject matter jurisdiction (including diversity jurisdiction) does not exist in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota for any such claim, then the exclusive forum and venue for any such action shall be the courts of the State of Minnesota located in Hennepin County, and you submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court. As to any proceeding in court, you and STAY ALIVE both waive your right to a jury trial, unless such waiver is unenforceable.

The choice-of-law and forum-selection provisions in this section do not apply to the Arbitration Agreement or to any arbitrable disputes as provided by the Arbitration Agreement section. Instead, as provided in the Arbitration Agreement section, the FAA shall apply to any such disputes.

Miscellaneous
These Terms & Conditions, including policies and information linked from or incorporated herein or otherwise found on the Site, constitute the entire agreement between you and STAY ALIVE with respect to the Site and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications, agreements, and proposals with respect to the Site. No provision of these Terms & Conditions shall be waived except pursuant to a writing executed by the party against whom the waiver is sought. No failure to exercise, partial exercise of, or delay in exercising any right or remedy under these Terms & Conditions shall operate as a waiver or estoppel of any right, remedy, or condition. Except as provided in the Arbitration Agreement section, if any provision of these Terms & Conditions is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected or impaired. You may not assign, transfer, or sublicense any of your rights or obligations under these Terms & Conditions without our express prior written consent. We will not be responsible for failure to fulfill any obligation due to causes beyond our control.
